## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
I need to be able to receive information for a specific city so that I can better plan my tourist activities. Would be good to make this app connect to an API that shares where there are violent-riots so that they can be avoided for safety.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Go with the flow lol (for now)...

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
-Express
-Nodemon
-Jquery
-JavaScript
-NPM
-Huroku

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. -->

## Credits and Collaborations
Ron - TA: Helped me to figure out that I needed to use potatoes.data.forEach()... to get into the array inside of the object in weather.json. SUCCESS!!!



Draw the web request response cycle for the task at hand (about 15 minutes).
Document the data flow: identify inputs and outputs for each part of the cycle.
Outline the functions that support this data flow.
Do a formal code review of each person’s code (15 minutes each).
Open your partner’s GitHub Pull Request on your laptop.
Identify an area in the code that:
you don’t understand
or seams overly complex
or you see a way to improve
or you want more information on
or you really like or think is interesting
Add kind comments or questions inline using the GitHub review feature.

I didn't understand how to do this portion, but after working with the code and then asking Ron, I was able to understand and fix/make my code work for the weather feature. I did most of the work. Ron helped me to figure out that I needed to use potatoes.data.forEach()... to get into the array inside of the object in weather.json. SUCCESS!!!
